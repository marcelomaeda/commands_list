docker run ? This command is used to start a new Docker container from an image.
docker ps ? This command is used to list all the running Docker containers.
docker stop ? This command is used to stop a running container.
docker rm ? This command is used to remove a Docker container.
docker images ? This command is used to list all the Docker images that are currently available on your system.
docker pull ? This command is used to download a Docker image from a registry.
docker exec ? This command is used to execute a command in a running container.
docker-compose ? This command is used to manage multi-container Docker applications.


Docker version
We usually start by finding the installed version of docker that we are working on. Here is how to find it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker --version
Docker version 18.09.6, build 481bc77
Docker search 
The ?docker search? command searches for specific images through the Docker hub. This command returns the specific information, including image name, description, automated, official stars, etc. Here is how to use it ? 

docker search MySQL
You can use the Docker Hub website to search through the GUI-based option.

Docker pull
As the name suggests, this command pulls a specific image from the Docker Hub. All you have to do is use the command ?docker pull? along with the name of the image. Here is an example of pulling an image without using the tag. 

docker pull --platform Linux/x86_64 MySQL
Here is an example that demonstrates how to pull an Apache HTTP server image from the Docker repository using the tag -
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/httpd
f5d23c7fed46: Pull complete
b083c5fd185b: Pull complete
bf5100a89e78: Pull complete
98f47fcaa52f: Pull complete
622a9dd8cfed: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:8bd76c050761610773b484e411612a31f299dbf7273763103edbda82acd73642
Status: Downloaded newer image for httpd: latest
greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$
The tags are used to identify the images inside the Docker hub. If you do not specify a tag, it will use the ?: latest? tag by default. 

We can use the command ?-all-tags? to pull all the images from the repository for multiple images. 

Docker run 
This command is used to create a container from an image. Here is how to do it ?

docker run --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw --detach mysql
The ??detach? option runs the container, and the ??env? option is used to set the mandatory variable. If you do not use the ??name? option, the docker will randomly assign a name to the container.

Docker ps
This command is used to list all the running containers in the background. Here is how to do it ?

docker ps --all
Docker stop 
The ?docker stop? command stops a container using the container name or its id. Here is how to do it ?

docker stop f8c52bedeecc
Docker restart 
This command is used to restart the stopped container. It is recommended to use this after rebooting the system. Here is how to do it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$
docker restart f8c52bedeecc
Docker kill
This command is used to stop the container immediately by killing its execution. While the ?docker stop? command helps shut down the container in its own time, the ?docker kill? command stops it at once. Here is to use it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$
docker kill 09ca6feb6efc
To check whether the container is stopped or killed, use the following command -
greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES

Docker exec 
This command is used to access the container that is running. Here is how to use it ?

docker exec -it test_db bash
mysql -uroot -pmy-secret-pw
SHOW DATABASES;
You have to either provide the name or the id of the container, which is ?test_db? in this case. The ?-i? and ?-t? options are used to access the interactive mode. 

Docker login
This command helps you to log into your docker hub. As you try to log in, you will be asked to give your docker hub credentials. 

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker login
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. Suppose you don?t have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com to create one.
Username: greatlearning

Docker commit 
This command is used to create or save an image of the edited container on the local system. 

Here is how to use it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$
docker commit 09ca6feb6efc greatlearning/httpd_image
sha256:d1933506f4c1686ab1a1ec601b1a03a17b41decbc21d8acd893db090a09bb31c
Here, ?greatlearning? is the username and ?httpd_image? is the image name of the edited container. 
Docker push 
This command helps push or upload a docker image on the repository or the docker hub. Here is how to use it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker push greatlearning/httpd_image
The push refers to the repository [docker.io/greatlearning/httpd_image]
734d9104a6a2: Pushed
635721fc6973: Mounted from library/httpd
bea448567d6c: Mounted from library/httpd

Docker network 
The ?docker network? command is used to know the details of the list of networks in the cluster. Here is how to use it ?

greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME                DRIVER              SCOPE
85083e755f04        bridge              bridge              local
f51d1f2379e0        host                host                local
5e5d9a154c00        none                null                local
Apart from this, you can also use the following docker network commands to manage networks -
Connect  - to connect a container to a network
Disconnect - to disconnect a container from a network
Create  - to create a network
Ls - to list all networks
Inspect - to display detailed information on one or more networks
prune - to remove all unused networks
rm - to remove one or more networks
Docker history 
This command is used to check the history of a docker image. The image name has to be mentioned while using the command. Here is how to use it -
greatlearning@greatlearning:/home/greatlearning$ docker history httpd
