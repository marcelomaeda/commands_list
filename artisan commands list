Here?s the list of useful Artisan commands you should know about:

php artisan list
Let?s start with the one that allows you to view the list of all available Artisan commands. It displays a table with names and descriptions of all commands.  

php artisan help
Another useful command that allows you to see commands? arguments and options. 

To view a help screen, type ?help? before the specific command?s name. For example: ?php artisan help migrate?.

php artisan make:model
This command creates a new model file in the app/Models directory. The class will have a standard structure and functions.

php artisan make:controller
Use ?php artisan make:controller? to generate a new controller class in the app/Http/Controllers directory. For instance, ?php artisan make controller UserController?.

With Artisan, you can also create a controller and a model together by typing ?php artisan make:controller UserController -m User?.

php artisan make:migration
This one creates a new file in the database/migrations directory. (Migrations allow you to adjust your database schema over time in a structured way.)

php artisan migrate
The command executes all pending migrations, which in turn updates the database schema to match the current status of the application. 

php artisan test 
It runs all the test cases in the tests/Unit directory, significantly streamlining the testing process by allowing you to run all the tests with a single command.

php artisan db:seed
Use this command to seed the database with test data. This allows you to test your app without manually generating test data each time.
